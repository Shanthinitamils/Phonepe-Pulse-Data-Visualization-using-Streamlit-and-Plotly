## About Phonepe pulse Data Visualization:
    PhonePe Pulse is a data visualization and exploration project that provides insights and information about the data in the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository from the year 2018 to 2023. It is a Python-based project that extracts data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository, transforms and stores it in a MySQL database or a CSV file, and displays it through an interactive dashboard using Streamlit, Plotly, and other visualization and data manipulation libraries. The solution includes various visualizations, allowing users to select different facts and figures to display. The project is efficient, secure, and user-friendly, providing valuable insights and information about the data in the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository.

## Lessons Learned

Data extraction: 
    Clone the Github using scripting to fetch the data from thePhonepe pulse Github repository and store it in a suitable format such as CSVor JSON.
Data transformation:
    Use a scripting language such as Python, along withlibraries such as Pandas, to manipulate and pre-process the data. This may include cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the datainto a format suitable for analysis and visualization.
Database insertion: 
    Use the "mysql-connector-python" library in Python to connect to a MySQL database and insert the transformed data using SQLcommands.
Dashboard creation: 
    Use the Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Plotly's built-in geo map functions can be used to display the data on a map and Streamlit can be used to create a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display.
Data retrieval: 
    Use the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to the MySQL database and fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe. Use the data in the dataframe to update the dashboard dynamically.

## problems faced:
    When visualizing PhonePe Pulse data, you may encounter a number of challenges and problems. For example, if you want to create a geographic map using the data, you may need to perform some data processing and cleaning in order to extract the relevant information and prepare it for visualization.

    One common problem when working with geographic data is that the data may not be in a format that is suitable for mapping. For example, the data may include latitude and longitude coordinates, but not the corresponding city or region names. In this case, you may need to use a geocoding service or library to convert the coordinates into city or region names, and then use a mapping library or tool to create the map.

    Another common problem is that the data may include errors, inconsistencies, or missing values. For example, the data may include typos, incorrect formatting, or missing values for certain fields. In this case, you may need to use data cleaning techniques, such as data normalization, data imputation, or data transformation, to correct the errors and prepare the data for visualization.

    To execute a query on PhonePe Pulse data for visualization, you will need to use a database management system or query language that is compatible with the data format and structure. For example, if the data is stored in a SQL database, you will need to use SQL queries to extract the relevant data for visualization. If the data is stored in a NoSQL database, you will need to use a NoSQL query language, such as MongoDB's query language, to extract the data.

    In general, visualizing PhonePe Pulse data can be a complex and challenging task, but it can also be a rewarding and informative experience. By using the right tools and techniques, you can create compelling and insightful visualizations that help you understand and communicate the trends and patterns in the data.

Here are some tips for visualizing PhonePe Pulse data:

    1.Use a mapping library or tool, such as Folium or Geopandas, to create geographic maps using the data.
    2.Use a data cleaning library or tool, such as Pandas or NumPy, to clean and prepare the data for visualization.
    3.Use a visualization library or tool, such as Matplotlib or Seaborn, to create charts, graphs, and other visualizations using the data.
    4.Use a database management system or query language, such as SQL or MongoDB, to extract the relevant data for visualization.
    5.Use a data analysis or machine learning library, such as Scikit-learn or TensorFlow, to perform advanced analysis and modeling on the data.
    6.By following these tips, you can create effective and informative visualizations of PhonePe Pulse data, and gain valuable insights into the trends and patterns in digital payments in India.

## Work flow

 This is a multi-page Streamlit app that allows users to explore and visualize data from the PhonePe Pulse dataset. The app includes the following pages:

            Home
            Transaction
            User
            State wise Growth
            Data Visualization

Home:

In Home page have an introduction about phonepe

Transaction:

    In transaction page displays a choropleth map of the total transaction amount by state in India. The app allows users to select the year and quarter that they want to view, and then displays the corresponding data on the map.

    The app uses the mysql.connector library to connect to a MySQL database and query the data. It then uses the pandas library to load the data into a DataFrame, and the plotly.express library to create the choropleth map.

    The app also uses the json library to load the geojson data for the map of India, and the streamlit library to create the user interface and display the map and data.

User:
  In User page displays a choropleth map of the total transaction count by state in India. The app allows users to select the year and quarter that they want to view, and then displays the corresponding data on the map.

    The app uses the mysql.connector library to connect to a MySQL database and query the data. It then uses the pandas library to load the data into a DataFrame, and the plotly.express library to create the choropleth map.
